Data description
We are working with deadliest aircraft accidents and incidents data-set.
Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deadliest_aircraft_accidents_and_incidents#:~:text=The%20most%20fatalities%20in%20any,747s%20collided%20on%20a%20runway.
The final data set consists of 544 observations and 8 variables.
At first the dataset consist of 555 observations of 13 variables, then we eliminated 11 obervations and 5 variables since data corresponding to these cells were missing .

Preparing Data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choosing the data-set of common interest
scraping the data-set
converting the dataset to  workable dataframe
cleaning the data-set(what problem we saw and decided to clean)
even after cleaning we were unable to work with dataset so we applied sapply to convert into numeric
cleaning ,converting 
changing the column names
finally storing the data as Airplane_crashes.Rdata file

Loading the Data set and visualization
since the data is stored in .Rdata file we therefore load the data using load( ) 
after loading the data set we plot the required visualization using ggplot2 library
